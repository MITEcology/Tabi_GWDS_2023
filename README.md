This is the data and code in R associated with the manuscript: "Protection from harvesting promotes energetically efficient structures in marine communities"

by Andrea Tabi, Luis J Gilarranz, Spencer A Wood, Jennifer A Dunne, and Serguei Saavedra.

The folder is comprised of code and data folders to reproduce the figures and results.
The script “Simulation_Fig1.R” generates the data from simulations and creates Figure 1 and Figure S2. 
The script “Fig3.R” generates Figure 3, which uses the result data file (data.RData). 
The script “Causal_inference.R” generates the results in Table 1, which sources the “pcalg.R” script and uses the result data file (data.RData).
